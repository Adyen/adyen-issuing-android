## Added
* Android 16 support: the SDK internals are updated to meet the requirements for Android 16 support.
* More documentation relating to whitelisting of client apps.

## Changed
* The SDK **compileSdk** version is now set to 36 (Android 16).
* Client application **compileSdk** now needs to be at least 35.
* Github repo renamed to [adyen-issuing-android](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-issuing-android/).
* Internal changes:
    * Updated Gradle: 8.9.0 -> 8.11.1
    * Updated Kotlin: 2.0.21 -> 2.1.21
    * Some functionality split out to separate `core` library

## Fixed
* In order to reduce the risk of theme namespace collisions, the provisioning library now uses a custom `AdyenProvisioning` theme rather than extending the Google `TapAndPay` theme.
